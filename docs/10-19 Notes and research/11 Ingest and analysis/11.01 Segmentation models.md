Segmentation models
===

Some of the OCR models seem to perform better if the area of interest is tightly cropped.

Segmentation models seem to be helpful in identifying these regions.  The following model can identify "signboard",
which identifies an approximate bounding box of the cumulative winnings.

In the actual dataset, the area of interest seems to be fairly fixed, so a % based crop is likely
to be more effective.
